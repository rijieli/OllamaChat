## Frequently Asked Questions:
### 1. I am getting a Server is unreachable error
- You need to download and install https://Ollama.ai and it must be running in the background for this interface to work.

### 2. How to change the target IP and port?
- You can modify the IP address and port in the settings. Ollama SwiftUI > Preferences

### 3. I am getting "Cannot Be Opened Because the Developer Cannot be Verified" error when trying to open the app
- To fix this go to your macos `System Settings > Privacy and Security > Allow Applications downloaded from > App Store and Identified Developer` and you will find a button saying `Open Anyway`
- This is completely normal. Open source applications are often not submitted to Apple for code review. You can read more about it [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac). This does not mean that the application is not safe. In fact, this is the beauty of open source. You can verify it yourself. 

### 4. I would like a new feature X

### 5. I found bug X
- Feel free to create a bug report by creating a new issue in the repo, or emailing me bugs@kghandour.com 
- This is a passion project so it will not be perfect and since I am doing it on my own time, I will try my best to get to it as soon as possible.

### 6. I would like to contribute to the project
- Please do so! It is amazing when contributing to open-source projects. Create a pull-request and I will try to review it as soon as possible. 

### 7. Are there any system requirements?
- This is a very simple light-weight user interface. As long as you can run https://ollama.ai locally, then this application should work as well.
